Resolve libc relative to sysroot

In the arm linux toolchain, libc.so is simply a link script that
points to the real libc.so shared library. However, the path of the
actual shared object is specified as an absolute path, which means
it is not resolved relative to the toolchain prefix or sysroot
directories. Adding '=' here causes ld to search for these files
relative to the library search directories.
